## Introduction to Application

The HeliosRise app uses the accelerometers to detect the user’s posture. The alarm only deactivates when the user stands up, ensuring they physically get out of bed. The app will adjust wake-up times based on traffic conditions, weather forecasts, the user’s target departure time, and destination to optimize waking up and commuting efficiently.
